# Train-Scheduler
firebase homework

**Assignment Overview:**

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

**Instructions:**

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

1. When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
1. Train Name
1. Destination 
1. First Train Time -- in military time
1. Frequency -- in minutes
1. Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
1. Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
